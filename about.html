        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Hello! We are a student organization at Michigan State University called CTRL+A. Our name is derived from the keyboard function ctrl + a, which means "select all". That is what we strive to do - we encourage all styles of dance and we welcome anyone who wants to join regardless of dance level. We are also an Asian-interset organization, meaning we work to represent and empower the APIDA community at MSU through various Asian cultural performances. At any event we perform at, we always try to include at least one cultural performance to meet our mission. See our past performances on our Youtube channel! </p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2018, CTRL+A started with just four members with a mission to create a dance group that was inclusive and allowed everyone to express themselves. Now with an average of over 80 members each year, we have established a family-like environment for our members. We have a fall and spring showcase each year as well as many other events that we perform at.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>As members and supporters of the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American undergraduate student body, we shall strive to represent and empower the APIDA community within a cultural context. CTRL+A shall act as an entity that celebrates diversity and expresses the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American experience through dance performances, while advocating for APIDA culture and representation at Michigan State University. CTRL+A hopes to provide members and supporters of the APIDA community with a space in which they should have freedom to express themselves and advocate for the community.</p>
